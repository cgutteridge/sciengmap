loudspeaker	Flat polymer loudspeaker		Fixed periods would be better	85	2209	secondary	A flat loudspeaker can be easily made by overlapping layers of rubber and perforated metal. An high voltage amplifier is needed to generate sound.	
caveman	Keeping caveman warm: turning animal furs into clothing	No				all	For thousands of years, humans kept warm by dressing in the furs and hides of animals they had hunted. Come and learn how prehistoric people used science to solve this most basic of survival challenges during the last ice age.	
bronze	Prehistoric metallurgy: smelting bronze age weapons		Ongoing, but with actual casting events approximately once per hour	behind-library		secondary	This smelting demonstration will use a simple charcoal-fuelled firing pit and valveless skin-bag bellows to melt oxidised copper and tin minerals. Come and watch the molten metal being poured into stone casts for the manufacture of Bronze artefacts.	
tools	Tools through time: 2 million years of technological innovation	No		behind-library		all	This event traces the origins of the axe through time from flint axes to Bronze age, Iron age, Viking and medieval examples.
